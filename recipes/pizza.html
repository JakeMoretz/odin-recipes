    <h2>How to make the best cheese pizza</h2>
        <p>This cheese pizza tastes just like what you’d expect from your classic pie,
             but infinitely better. It’s sophisticated enough for adults, but loved by all kids. 
             We’ve tested on multiple kids in our lives, and they’re 100% in love with this cheese pizza. 
             Here’s what makes this cheese pizza better than your normal delivery pizza:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ball Best Pizza Dough (or Food Processor Dough or Thin Crust Dough)</li>
                <li>1/3 cup Easy Pizza Sauce</li>
                <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>4 ounces (1 cup) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the pizza dough:</strong>
                    Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. 
                    Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven). 
                    Slice into pieces and serve immediately. Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes 
                    to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li><br>
                <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven</li><br>
                <li><strong> the pizza sauce: </strong>Make the Easy Pizza Sauce.</li><br>
                <li><strong> Prepare the toppings:</strong> Slice or tear the fresh mozzarella into small pieces. </li><br>
                <li><strong>Bake the pizza: </strong>When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour.
                     (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed 
                     baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see 
                     How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.</li><br>
                <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the pieces of fresh 
                    mozzarella cheese evenly across the dough, then top with the shredded mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle evenly with the 
                    garlic powder, dried oregano, and a few pinches of kosher salt.</li><br>
                <li>
                    Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and 
                    crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li><br>
